    "### Task 01.01 (14 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Do a literature research to find a research paper that fulfills the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "* There is an application in the social sciences (broadly)\n",
    "* The authors use neural nets for a substantial part of their analysis, in particular they rely on a method from the domain of deep learning\n",
    "* The work is at maximum three years old (has been published after the 15th of April 2021)\n",
    "* It was published in a journal, as a conference publication or as pre-print (for example on arXiv)\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide a few paragraphs (1/2 page each, ~250 words) of text covering those three points (1 1/2 pages in total, ~750 words):\n",
    "\n",
    "* In one sentence, state your intial motivation to choose the paper. Then provide a review of the work, starting with a short summary, then identfying key strengths as well as weaknesses and finally provide an overall assessment of the quality of the work.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Do background research on the specific method from the domain of neural nets and deep learning specifically that the authors used. Identify and read at least one of the key references connected to the specific method and cite it. Give a short characterisation of the connection of that method to the current state of the art of deep learning and try to place that method historically in the field. Mention if the method is in any way specific to the problem that it was used for by the authors and reconstruct the rationale behind the choice of exactly that method.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Review the publication outlet of your work. If it was published in a journal, describe the focus of that journal and do a quick search in the last published editions of that journal to assess if they regularly publish works with a connection to deep learning there. If it was published in conference proceedings, do a background research on the conference and situate it in the broader field it belongs too. If the work was published as pre-print, try to find if it was published in other form in another outlet. If not, use the metadata on the pre-print platform (as for example the category the work was placed in) to characterise it further. In any case, for all different forms of publication outlets, do a background research on the authors and provide a short assessment of their fields, research groups and typical research topics."
