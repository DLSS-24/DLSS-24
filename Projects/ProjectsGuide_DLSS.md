# Deep Learning for Social Sciences: Projects Guide

The course assessment is based on a final course project. Projects are done in groups that can have at most 4 students and must mix students with different backgrounds (at least two different backgrounds per group). The purpose of the project is to show what you have learned in the course in terms of the basics of neural networks, data management, analysis and interpretation. The lecturers will propose projects that start from a well-defined social scientific research question with an empirical focus using a technique from deep learning covered in the course. At the same time, participants should critically reflect on those methods, what conclusions they can take from them and their limitations.

The timeline of the project deadlines can be found below. The deadlines are up to the end of the day in Germany marked by each date.

- **04.06.2024:** Assignment of project topics.
- **02.07.2024:** Project presentations session
- **27.08.2024:** Deadline for submission of final report. 

The steps to do the course project are the following:

#### 1. Form a group and choose a topic

Get in touch as early as possible with fellow students over the course discord server or around lectures to form a group. You can use the same group composition as in former courses, but you don't have to.

#### 2. Project assignment

The lecturers will prepare detailed project task descriptions for each of the project groups and assign one of them to each group. You can check out [an example project here](ProjectExample_DLSS.md).

#### 3. Project presentations

During project presentation sessions, students give **5-minute** presentations about their projects. Students get questions from lecturers regarding their understanding of the topic and feedback on how to improve the project for the final report.

Each presentation has to contain four slides:

1) Short recap of the assigned research question and methods
2) Work plan, assessment of potential problems or problems already encountered
3) Preliminary results
4) Conclusion and critique

All members of the group have to participate in their presentation (for example presenting one slide each) and be present to reply to questions by the lecturers. The time for the presentation is restricted to **5 minutes**. It is important that you learn to synthesize and summarize the project, please practice the presentation substantially because taking longer will affect the project grade.

#### 4. Submit the final report

Send a final report as a PDF document (max. 6 pages, min. font size 11pt) via email (max.pellert@uni-konstanz.de & giordano.de-marzo@uni-konstanz.de).
References do not count towards this 6-page limit. Projects should contain a link to a Github repository including the code to produce results, datasets linked or shared if they can be shared, and additional figures or tables that can be referenced from the project report.

Project reports should follow this structure:

1. Data Presentation and Preliminary Analysis
2. Deep Learning Model Implementation
3. Research Analysis

Plots should be correctly shown (named axes, visible scales) and writing has to be understandable.

Use the methods covered in the course but also try to assess the uncertainty of your answers and comment on these results in the research analysis part. The critique part is essential. An important objective of this course is to develop a critical understanding of the opportunities and limitations of deep learning methods and the data that we will use.

After your project presentations, we might suggest feedback on your current project action plan. We will keep track of this feedback and expect that you incorporate it in your final project report. If something could not be done then we expect that you explain why.

## Project grading

The grade for the project is composed of 10% for the presentation and 90% for the final report (30% for each of the 3 thematic blocks of the report). Extra points are given when projects are based on open science principles (e.g. data and all nicely documented code are available in a Github repository) and when data sources or methods go beyond what is covered in the course. **Projects do not need to report "positive results",** what is important is that you show how you have **shown visibly credible effort** to address your research questions, document any issues or deviations, and critically reflect on methods and results. Remember for the overall grade, that on top of the project presentation and report (60%) you can individually achieve an additional 4x10% (up to 40%) with handing in the assignment solutions.

## Frequently asked questions

- **Do I have to work in a group?**
Yes, individual projects are not allowed. You can use collaborative tools like Github and videoconference technologies to coordinate your project. You can divide tasks as long as you all contribute to the project.

- **Can we change the question or project topic?**
No, we devised the project task descriptions carefully and with detailed information. This is for you to have the best learning outcome from the course. Should you discover grave problems with the assigned tasks (for example with the dataset or some other aspect) then tell us and we will find a solution together.

- **What if some dataset or method turns out to work differently than we planned?**
This can always happen and there is no problem with changing some aspect about the data retrieval or analysis, as long as you document these well in your report and argue about the changes. What you cannot change is the question and motivation of your project or do arbitrary, unjustified changes to the plan.

- **What if we don't get "nice" results or don't fit our expectations?**
As long as you followed the task descriptions, the particular results that you get will not factor into the grade. If you get a negative result or a surprising answer, comment on that in the conclusion section and reflect on it in your critique section. Follow our recommendations and feedback during the course and comment on them in your report if for some reason you couldn't follow them.

- **How can we share our code and data with you?**
You can share code and data by setting up a Github repository and including a link in your report. You will get extra points if the repository is well documented and might help other people in their analyses!
